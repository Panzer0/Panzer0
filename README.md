### 🥝 Hi there! 

I'm Daniel Wieczorek, a Computer Science graduate from the Łódź University of Technology. I am passionate about artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the Internet of things. When I'm not coding, I enjoy indoor climbing, tabletop RPGs, fiction writing (a novel is in the works!) and PC gaming.

I believe in the power of open source collaboration and enjoy working with others on meaningful projects. Feel free to take a look below to see some of the projects I've worked on. If you'd like to connect or discuss potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to reach out.
